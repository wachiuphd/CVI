From Gaige Kerr: Some colleagues (Robbie and Cascade; cc'ed) have some data that might be useful for you: https://github.com/rmp15/PRISM-grids-into-political-entities-USA The data at this link represent approximated wet bulb globe temperature at the county level, and there are many more details provided on the website. I should stress that the data are preliminary and it might be possible to also produce county-level daily heat index values following National Weather Services procedures. 
Julie Golke will be working on finding a new dataset at the 1km level, but let's use this new dataset for the Beta version for the tool.
